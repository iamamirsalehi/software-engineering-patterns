# SOLID 

Why do we need SOLID? 
I believe that most of developers know the 5 principles of SOLID but they don't know why they are using it, before reading the following sentence ask yourself if you could explain solid in just **one word** what would it be?

The word is **Change**, We all follow the SOLID to make our code changeable, so if we wanted to write a project that we would never change it, maybe it's pointless to apply SOLID to our code.
