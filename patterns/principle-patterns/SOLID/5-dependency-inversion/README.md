# Dependency Inversion

Depend on abstractions, not on concretions. <br />

The name of this principle contains the word “inversion,” from which we may infer
that without following this principle we would usually depend on concretions, not on
abstractions. The principle tells us to invert that direction: we should always depend on
abstractions.
