See the mind map in detail: https://mm.tt/app/map/3600495906?t=ouhxD4pmvM

`Note`: to rate our undrestanding, we rate every pattern out of 5, every number from 1 to 5 has its own meaning

1. Understood the aim of the pattern
2. Understood the real example of pattern in the day-to-day life
3. Found some examples in the product code or open-source projects
4. Implemented an example in github gist
5. Sign of the pattern

If you follow all the 5 steps you understood the pattern deeply
